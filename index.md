Hello, world!

We're coding community from Guatemala called `code !guns`. Our focus is digital accessibility and online self-defense for indigenous communities. 

| Our (current) work |
| ----------- |
| Radio broadcasting |
| Community coordination apps |
| Language accessibility |
| Digital self defense |

If you're interested in working on these problems, we've create a social media account where you can DM us [@CodeNotGuns](https://twitter.com/CodeNotGuns). Especially if you have social media, writing, or design skills, or are fluent in any Mayan languages, that helps massively.

We have so much work on our hands, though, that we need all the help we can get and anyone is welcome.

## FAQ

> Do you use X tech stack?

We're building elaborate infrastructure from the ground up. We need *everything*. Do you know CSS? Have you soldered together a FM autoscanner? Do you think Rust is cool? Can you explain complex ideas in an easy-to-understand way? 

The only question that matters is _do you want to help_? If so, reach out and we'll tell you how to hop on our weekly call.

Good luck, only the best will make it!

> Who *are* you?

We're some friends from Guatemala, and more friends from the Internet. We provide the rural Mayan community with technology training to empower them to fight back online.

>  Why is this page in English instead of Poqomchi or whatever?!?!?

Cuz that's what the internet speaks, but if you wanna translate this page to X language, we accept your offer!
